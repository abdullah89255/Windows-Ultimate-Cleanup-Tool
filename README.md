# Windows-Ultimate-Cleanup-Tool
Absolutely — I can create a **full Windows Cleanup Tool** that removes:

✔ Junk files
✔ Temp files
✔ Windows cache
✔ Broken leftover files
✔ Log files
✔ Browser cache
✔ Software leftover folders
✔ Empty directories
✔ Recycle Bin
✔ Crash dumps
✔ Windows Update leftovers

This will be a **single .BAT tool** you can run anytime.

# one single .BAT tool (AllInOne_Cleaner.bat)
---
that builds and runs an embedded PowerShell engine.
It includes:
---
* 🔥 **Deep Cleaner** (very aggressive optional; dry-run by default)
* 🧹 **Registry Cleaner** (safe defaults + backup/export before any change)
* 🚀 **Performance Booster** (toggle common non-critical bloat services — prompt & explain)
* 🧼 **Startup Program Cleaner** (lists startup items and removes selected ones)
* 📦 **Junk Cleaner with GUI** (PowerShell window GUI for ease of use)
* 🧲 **SSD-optimized cleaning** (TRIM check, light defrag optimization, disable scheduled defrag when SSD detected)
* ✅ All operations create logs and backups (files backed up as ZIP, registry exported) when destructive actions are chosen
* ❗ **Dry-run by default** — nothing destructive runs unless you explicitly confirm per-action or pass `-ExecuteAll` from the menu.
